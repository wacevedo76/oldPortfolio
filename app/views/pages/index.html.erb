      <p>Hello all,</p>
      <p>This site exists not only to showcase my abilities as a web developer but to have a place to play with differenet web design ideas.</p>
      <p>I spent the better part of this week working on this site's responsive features, the navigation button that appears in place of the rightside navigation at fullscreen, but I still hadn't published this site yet.</p>
      <p>... therefore, while this site can be described as "sparce" at the moment, I'll be filling it with new content and features as the week, month and year progresses.</p>

      <h2 class="index-header">That took some time...</h2>
      <p>So my last post (or first post) was written twenty-five or so days agao, and you might be wondering why it took me so long to write another post. Well, here is the long of it.</p>
      <p>It actually took me this long to deploy my app, and along the way I learned a lot of things about deploying a Rails app: I learned a great deal about webservers (Appache2 and Nginx), a bit about applications servers (Passenger mainly) and working with Virtual Private Machines and Setting up firewalls and ... and after twenty-five days, I still hadn't deployed.</p>
      <p>I was learning a whole little about a whole bunch of things, but finally decided to just deploy to heroku now and learn and play with these things along the way because it's better to have a project that works out now and improve then to wait till everything is just right, but never deploy at all.</p>
      <p>... more to come.</p>

      <h2 class="index-header">Night and day...</h2>
      <p>So I began implementing a night and day mode for my site, once they are ready, I'll include a moon and a sun icon somewhere in the same location on all of the pages... which would give the apperace that they are placed there statically.</p>
      <p>coincidentally, CSS custom properties are pretty cool.</p>
      <p>Okay, so I've been thinking about the features to implement on this site, and aside from making the site look less than an eighties-style professional business card (which is what I had intended), when I finish the night/day mode feature. I'll: <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>implement a proper blog feature, CMS style (though, the blog markup doesn't take all that much time). Though, that will be difficult to show.</li>
          <li>a bug tracker, to share my woes with the rest of the world.</li>
          <li>(possibly) a time tracker</li>
        </ul>
      <p>The CSS for the Night/Day modes is pretty much done.. just have to work out the JavaScript, should be done by tomorrow.
      Okay, have a good day all.</p>

      <h2 class="index-header">SVGs, need to learn more :)</h2>
      <p>I finished the Day/Night mode feature last night, searched on Font Awesome for a sun and a moon icon, easy peasy I thought...</p>
      <p>First issue, for some reason the Font Awesome links didn't work. Now, what's strange is that the icons at the bottom of the page are also from Font Awesome. So I assumed that the service was linked / referenced correctly and I checked the links that I had just entered with the links in the footer. They appeared to be formatted the same way.</p>
      <p>Okay, so I think to myself, let me just download the svgs, place them in the assets pipeline (Rails Speak), use Rails helper links and I can use them just like I use them when they're linked from Font Awesome... HA! Then reality hits..  these are NOT FONTS! They're IMAGES!</p>
      <p>I have to thank Font Awesome for such a cool service. It's obvious to all who read this and who do frontend work that I don't know much about svg images. Cool subject, I've got to learn more about it.  However, for now, I've got to move on.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, I put out my CV page. I'll get the content out by tomorrow afternoon, and hopefuly I can get the responsive feature finished by Friday.</p>
      <p>Monday morning, I'll start a 5 day sprint to work on my bug tracker. I'm putting my Blog CMS feature on the backburner for the immediate, thought about it and realized that the cms feature will require Authorization and Authentication.</p>
      <p>Authentication, not real a problem... Authorization is a different animal entirely.</p>
      <p>Okay, have a good day.</p>
