      <h2 class="index-header">My journey continues...</h2>
      <p>On Friday afternoon I recieved and email from a recruiter... which I thought was a nice change from the boiler-plate rejection emails I had usually recieved from recruiters and hireing managers and so forth...</p>
      <p>... maybe there is something to building a portfolio website... but I digress</p>
      <p>Moving forward, I will be refering to this recruiter using the pronouns they, them, and their to protect that person's identity, out of professional courtesy</p>
      <p>Now, I fully understand the need for caution when hiring, generally speaking, the process is expensive, time consuming, and can be filled with legal problems if the wrong person is hired, not to mention the ramifications for the people involeved with hiring a person un or under qualified for a position.
      So knowing this, I fully understand and accept that finding my first position as a developer is going to be difficult.</p>
      <p>I was unsurprisingly excited when I recived the recruters email informing me that they had shown interest in me and where interested in moving forward in the interview process, but that they wanted to get a better sence of how well I coded, therefore I was given a series of six tasks to complete, and that I was given four days to complete them from the time the email was sent.</p>
      <p>I recieved the email at 15:41 (my local time) on Friday, but didn't look at it until about an hour and a half afterwards</p>
      <p>The tasks I was given were contained in a Github repo and I will give basic descriptions of the tasks (in order to protect the intelectual property of said company):
          <ol>
            <li>Using an API
                <ul>
                  <li>I had to pull three sets of data off of an api and apply this data to a set of pre-existing
                    data, this new data could not be saved to the database.
                  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Building an API
              <ul>
                <li>Using the pre-existing seed data, I was to use this data to create two versions of an api.
                  The second had features that extended from the first.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Troubleshoot a long running task.
              <ul>
                <li>The system (web app) simulated that two seperate tasks, emails some data and emailing a list of data in CSV format. I was to arrange that the user didn't have to wait for the page to load in order to get the emails
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Run bracket's validation
              <ul>
                <li>I was to validate that brackets ({} []) where matched, nested properly and not empty... I was to do this with a set of validations set at the model... I was also told that Regular Expressions would not work.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Implement a comment feature
              <ul>
                <li>I was to set up a comments feature, and that the users of the system could only make one comment on each of the objects, the user would have to delete the comment in order to create another one (or edit their pre-existing comment).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Run an sql query based on the comment system in the previous task.
              <ul>
                <li>I was to create a page where the top 10 commenters would be listed for the previous seven days.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        Needless to say, I was excited to tackle the tasks, and I figured that I had four days (Friday afternoon to Saturday (1) Saturday to Sunday (2) Sunday to Monday (3) Monday to Tuesday (I was told Midnight day four)). It was end of day Friday, and I didn't want to bother the recruiter as it was the begining of the weekend, so off to work I went.
      </p>
      <p>.. its is late, and I've been working long hours since Friday, I'll continue my story tomorrow.</p>

      <h2 class="index-header">And so it begins.</h2>
      <p>So this moring, cup of coffee in hand, I sat down and began thinking about the user stories for a bug tracking system.</p>
      <p>Now, I've never worked in a professional enviornment, and so while I had a pretty good idea what features were inportant in a bug tracker, I didn't want to just start coding away only to have to stop and backtrack because I had overlooked some important feature/dependency. So I decided that a better way of spending the next hour was to do some research.. and research I did!</p>
        <p>I stubled on a few resources, I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rwBbhur9dw&t=62s" target="_blank">Youtube Link</a> that described what bug tracking / issue tracking software does, but at an elementary level. It was a five minute watch, and aside from the generated voice it wasn't half bad.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, I did some more googling and stubled upon a pretty interesting design source from Oracle: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E14373_01/appdev.32/e13363/issue_track_obj.htm#HTMAD010" target="_blank">How to design an Issue Tracking Application</a>. This page is part of the "Application Express Advanced Tutorials" series hosted by Oracle and I thought that it was a really good starting point for collecting the application specs.</p>
        <p>Of particular interest to me was the data models (here's a link => <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E14373_01/appdev.32/e13363/img/ui_data_model.gif" target="_blank">IMAGE</a>). I'll be using these three models as the data store for my issue tracking app (thanks Oracle).</p>
        <p>Last night I added the <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise" target="_blank">Devise</a> Gem to my portfolio for authentication, generated the views and began customizing them, figured I could do this all day and still not be happy, so I then stopped, pushed to Github, merged the branch, updated local, pushed to Heroku, migrated the database, created a user for myself and then disabled registration... because who'd really want an account on this site... it isn't as if I offer anything worth anything yet :)</p>
        <p> on a related note, I started using MS Visual Code today. Really nice editor, builtin terminal, which is nice. I'll have to figure out how to make Power line look a bit better. But It is a bit faster than Atom, which in my limited experience is a nice editor. I tip my hat to Kjartan Manvelyan for the recommendation.</p>
        <p>Okay, just writing now because I doubt I'll have a chance later. Have a great day.</p>

      <h2 class="index-header">Not finished yet, but when will it ever be :)</h2>
      <p>So it took a week to finish my cv... well, we did have a four day weekend where I didn't touch the 'puter. The fonts and font colors are a bit on the bland side. Never-the-less...</p>
      <p>Now that these two pages are done, I can begin my first real non-static project.</p>
      <p>in the last two months or so, I've been listening to you-tubers who are (or claim to be) professional web developers, and one of them (I will link to them when I am able to find the vid) presented the idea of creating a bug tracking system. It will take me a day to create the user stories. Another day to create the database structure and the data flow, and then two, maybe three days to get the wire frame going and some more time for aesthetics.  So, I'm looking at a four to five day sprint on my new bug tracking app, though I think I am overestemating how much time it will actually take.  I'll keep you posted on my progress :)</p>

      <h2 class="index-header">SVGs, need to learn more :)</h2>
      <p>I finished the Day/Night mode feature last night, searched on Font Awesome for a sun and a moon icon, easy peasy I thought...</p>
      <p>First issue, for some reason the Font Awesome links didn't work. Now, what's strange is that the icons at the bottom of the page are also from Font Awesome. So I assumed that the service was linked / referenced correctly and I checked the links that I had just entered with the links in the footer. They appeared to be formatted the same way.</p>
      <p>Okay, so I think to myself, let me just download the svgs, place them in the assets pipeline (Rails Speak), use Rails helper links and I can use them just like I use them when they're linked from Font Awesome... HA! Then reality hits..  these are NOT FONTS! They're IMAGES!</p>
      <p>I have to thank Font Awesome for such a cool service. It's obvious to all who read this and who do frontend work that I don't know much about svg images. Cool subject, I've got to learn more about it.  However, for now, I've got to move on.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, I put out my CV page. I'll get the content out by tomorrow afternoon, and hopefuly I can get the responsive feature finished by Friday.</p>
      <p>Monday morning, I'll start a 5 day sprint to work on my bug tracker. I'm putting my Blog CMS feature on the backburner for the immediate, thought about it and realized that the cms feature will require Authorization and Authentication.</p>
      <p>Authentication, not real a problem... Authorization is a different animal entirely.</p>
      <p>Okay, have a good day.</p>

      <h2 class="index-header">Night and day...</h2>
      <p>So I began implementing a night and day mode for my site, once they are ready, I'll include a moon and a sun icon somewhere in the same location on all of the pages... which would give the apperace that they are placed there statically.</p>
      <p>coincidentally, CSS custom properties are pretty cool.</p>
      <p>Okay, so I've been thinking about the features to implement on this site, and aside from making the site look less like an eighties-style professional business card (which is what I had intended), when I finish the night/day mode feature. I'll: <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>implement a proper blog feature, CMS style (though, the blog markup doesn't take all that much time). Though, that will be difficult to show.</li>
          <li>a bug tracker, to share my woes with the rest of the world.</li>
          <li>(possibly) a time tracker</li>
        </ul>
      <p>The CSS for the Night/Day modes is pretty much done.. just have to work out the JavaScript. If all works out, I'll've finished it come 'morrow night.
      Okay, have a good day all.</p>

      <h2 class="index-header">That took some time...</h2>
      <p>So my last post (or first post) was written twenty-five or so days agao, and you might be wondering why it took me so long to write another post. Well, here is the long of it.</p>
      <p>It actually took me this long to deploy my app, and along the way I learned a lot of things about deploying a Rails app: I learned a great deal about webservers (Appache2 and Nginx), a bit about applications servers (Passenger mainly) and working with Virtual Private Machines and Setting up firewalls and ... and after twenty-five days, I still hadn't deployed.</p>
      <p>I was learning a whole little about a whole bunch of things, but finally decided to just deploy to Heroku now and learn and play with these things along the way. Tis better to have a live project now and improve than to wait till everything is just right, but never deploy at all.</p>
      <p>... more to come.</p>

      <h2 class="index-header">My first ...</h2>
      <p>Hello all,</p>
      <p>This site exists not only to showcase my abilities as a web developer, but to have a place to play with differenet web design ideas.</p>
      <p>I spent the better part of this week working on this site's responsive features, the navigation button that appears in place of the rightside navigation at fullscreen, but I still hadn't published this site yet.</p>
      <p>... therefore, while this site can be described as "sparce" at the moment, I'll be filling it with new content and features as the week, month and year progresses.</p>
